After the data has been extracted and transformed, we need to store the data somewhere, otherwise we'd lose all our work.

There are many options for data storage. What to choose will depend on our needs. For example, with structured data, a 
relational database like SQL could be appropriate. If the data fits in a Pandas DataFrame, then a CSV file might work 
well. Part of a data engineer's job is to know how to work with different data storage options. 

Below is a few link about popular data storage system beyond SQL:
