# Data Engineering
The role of a data engineer can vary a lot depends on the type and the size of companies. 

At a large company, there is usually dedicated data engineer who pull from many sources, and pipeline the data into a usable form. These sources
can include website logs, smartphone app logs, user data, transaction data, sensor data, etc. Analysts can then use 
these results for dashboard visualization, predictive models, business decisions, recommendations, or other data 
science applications. 

Smaller companies often do not have the resources for a dedicated data engineer. For these companies, a data scientist 
might have more than one role taking on at least some of the responsiblities of a data engineer. 

As data scientists, we focus much of our time on building mathematical, machine learning, and domain specific business skills. However, improving
our engineering skills can prove valuable for getting us start with machine learning projects on our own at a smaller 
companies, and collaborate better with data engineering team later on when the projects and the size of the companies expand.
