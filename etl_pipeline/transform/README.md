# Transform
In the context of data science, transformation usually involves getting data ready for a machine learning algorithm.
For example, the project data could come from more than one source, one from a CSV file, another from a SQL database.
We need to extract data from those two sources separately, then combine them together. Or perhaps we need to clean the 
data, engineer new features. Hence, we're transforming the original datasets to create a new dataset.

In this part, we will practice several data transformation techniques, such as:
+ Combining & cleaning data
+ Working with different data encodings
+ Removing duplicate rows
+ Dummy variables
+ Remove outliers
+ Normalize data
+ Engineer new features
